# Abstractive Text Summarization using Encoder-Decoder Models

## Overview

The Abstractive Text Summarization using Encoder-Decoder Models project demonstrates the application of encoder-decoder models, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models, for generating abstractive summaries from input text. The project includes a React frontend and a Django backend to provide users with an interactive interface for inputting text and receiving abstractive summaries.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for inputting text and receiving abstractive summaries.
- Django backend for handling user input and interacting with the LSTM model.
- Encoder-decoder LSTM model for generating abstractive summaries.

## Usage

1. Access the web application through your browser.
2. Input the text you want to summarize.
3. Click the "Generate Summary" button to receive an abstractive summary.
4. Review the generated summary on the page.
